A half duplex system can both transmit and receive but can not do both simultaneously. Instead, the system transmits for a period of time and receives for the remaining. Therefore, the system is designed in three stages- transmitter, receiver and then integration of the two. Once designed, the USRP is expected to work in parallel with the existing Keysight systems used at the Testbed if not replace them. In this work, USRP N321 by Ettus Research is used. The USRP is a software defined radio that uses software as a substitute for components implemented in hardware. The accompanying technical report details the procedures involved in setting up the USRP- the associated software, interfacing and verification of function. This document also discusses the design of a transmitter and receiver using GNU Radio and the associated challenges. The designed systems are tested using a Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) and Vector Signal Generator (VSG) and data that adheres to the 5G standards is generated using MATLAB.\n","date":1596622364,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597075135,"objectID":"7aec1ed776937bad92e820770174a6c7","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/project/research/5g-half-duplex/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T15:42:44+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/research/5g-half-duplex/","section":"project","summary":"Summary This work develops a half duplex system operating at 122.88 MSPS and transmitting data generated according to 5G NR standards using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP).

This has been a topic of great study and several techniques relying on matrix methods exist for this task. Non-negative matrix factorization is one such technique popularly used for its representational power and ease of implementation. In this work, NMF is introduced, the central algorithm based on multiplicative update rules is discussed and a comparison is drawn between local implementations of the algorithm and the implementation in scikit-learn. Following this, variants of the original algorithm utilising priors of sparseness and temporal continuity are used to perform source separation on mixtures of musical notes. The variation of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is studied for different variants of NMF, different windows and window lengths and different weights of the sparseness and temporal continuity cost functions.\n","date":1587313807,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597075135,"objectID":"b5de41de8fa01638bd36282cd9a5ca34","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/project/research/source-separation/","publishdate":"2020-04-19T22:00:07+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/research/source-separation/","section":"project","summary":"A study of NMF and its use in audio source separation.","tags":["SPandComms","Project"],"title":"Source Separation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Abstract LIGO interferometers used to detect gravitational waves achieve extremely high sensitivity through precise angular control of suspended optics that direct the laser beam.

Almost entirely student run, it encompasses a number of educational events and competitions for the technically inclined, lectures on a myriad of topics ranging from neuroscience and AI to policy and art for those seeking knowledge and four evening shows that are simply superb spectacles.\n  Evolve is a team within Shaastra that traditionally has three departments- Spotlight which organizes lectures, Summit which generally focuses on one or two themes and puts together conference style events and related competitions and a third department that does something unique every year.\nSpotlight organizes lectures- both live and virtual- starting in August and right until the end of Shaastra. Speakers are invited from across the world to deliver a lecture at IIT Madras via emails, calls and using a number of other networking strategies. Spotlight often collaborates with other organizations and conferences such as Center for Computational Brain Research and the Indian Science Congress. Over the course of the four days of Shaastra, Spotlight sees an audience of about four thousand at IIT Madras and even more online. As a Head of the Spotlight Team, I led a team of 15 to put together 13 lectures throughout the course of my tenure. The following is a list of speakers who spoke at Shaastra 2019.\n               Apart from these lectures, Spotlight also hosted two remote lectures by Dr. Peter Norvig and Dr. Jaap Haartsen and also organized ShaastraX. With the theme being the rapidly evolving technology of Blockchain, this TEDx style event catered exclusively to working professionals.\nAs a Head, my work involved building the team and equipping the members with the right set of skills, making financial choices regarding logistics (travel and accommodation for speakers, props and equipment and so forth), coordinating with external organizations such as CCBR, assigning duties to different members ( coordinators) of the team and seeing them through.\nWorking with Evolve 2019 was one of the most defining experiences of my undergraduate life and has not only given my invaluable skills but also helped me make indelible memories that cherish and hold very dear!\n","date":1557036642,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597075135,"objectID":"d761e507f4fbf5bf095d7b2d4222f7d3","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/project/events/evolve2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T11:40:42+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/events/evolve2019/","section":"project","summary":"Head, Team Spotlight, Team Evolve, Shaastra 2018","tags":["Event Organization","Shaastra"],"title":"Evolve 2019","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588681229,"objectID":"5b51a87aaf983c6178c5100159e4c0be","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/my_projects/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/my_projects/","section":"","summary":"Research projects I've worked on over the years","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Milind Kumar V"],"categories":[],"content":"Shaastra is IIT Madras\u0026rsquo; four day annual technical festival. Almost entirely student run, it encompasses a number of educational events and competitions for the technically inclined, lectures on a myriad of topics ranging from neuroscience and AI to policy and art for those seeking knowledge and four evening shows that are simply superb spectacles. Evolve is a team within Shaastra that traditionally has three departments- Spotlight which organizes lectures, Summit which generally focuses on one or two themes and puts together conference style events and related competitions and a third department that does something unique every year.\nSpotlight organizes lectures- both live and virtual- starting in August and right until the end of Shaastra. Speakers are invited from across the world to deliver a lecture at IIT Madras via emails, calls and using a number of other networking strategies. Spotlight often collaborates with other organizations and conferences such as Center for Computational Brain Research and the Indian Science Congress. Over the course of the four days of Shaastra, Spotlight sees an audience of about four thousand at IIT Madras and even more online. Speakers at Shaastra 2018 are featured below.\n  Apart from the above speakers, Spotlight 2018 also hosted the Table Tennis icon Sharath Kamal, the terrific inventor Ron Klein and screened the AlphaGo movie. We also organized the first ShaastraX (a TEDx style event) which saw entrepreneurs, social activists and scientists speak to over 400 schoolchildren. As a coordinator in Spotlight 2018, I worked in a team of 10 to determine who to invite to Shaastra 2018, reached out to potential speakers, organized their visit and lecture, designed and prepared the necessary props to enhance audience and speaker experience and managed a team of 8 volunteers who assisted with logistics. Personally, I was responsible for the lectures of Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg, Prof. Geoffrey Hinton and Prof. Vilayanur Ramachandran.\nSpotlight 2018 was my first serious foray into event organization and helped me learn a great deal. Even more importantly, it allowed me to understand IIT Madras better and meet some really extraordinary people!\n","date":1525500646,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597075135,"objectID":"514a763dd7fbe864ecf13062e695bcc0","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/project/events/evolve2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-05T11:40:46+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/events/evolve2018/","section":"project","summary":"Coordinator, Team Spotlight, Team Evolve, Shaastra 2018","tags":["Event Organization","Shaastra"],"title":"Evolve 2018","type":"project"},{"authors":["Milind Kumar V"],"categories":[],"content":"The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted life throughout the world. One area of life that has witnessed dramatic change with the ubiquitous shift to online communication is education. Schools throughout India are attempting to rapidly shift to online teaching and the period of transition can often be difficult for both students and teachers alike. CoEdu attempts to fill this void by bringing together students from different streams of engineering and at different levels of study (undergraduate or graduate) from IIT Madras and connecting them to schools and schoolchildren who can benefit from their expertise. While subjects traditionally covered in a school are presented to make up for the lack of in person teaching, great emphasis is also placed on introducing children from classes 8-12 to subjects such as AI or equip them with skills such as coding in order to enable them to comprehend, and contribute to, the technology driven world of the future. We also aspire to accomodate individual mentoring for students in the near future. As someone passionate about education, working with this team has allowed me to experience firsthand the challenges of making knowledge accessible and the excitement of teaching.\n","date":1523100092,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597075135,"objectID":"b6aeeb5bd44023b42cb81947e117aae0","permalink":"https://milind-blaze.github.io/project/events/coedu2020/","publishdate":"2018-04-07T16:51:32+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/events/coedu2020/","section":"project","summary":"Student Mentor, CoEdu India, 2020","tags":["Event Organization"],"title":"CoEdu India","type":"project"},{"authors":["Milind Kumar V"],"categories":[],"content":"   The Inter IIT Sports meet is the annual inter college sports tournament in which 23 of the IITs participate.
